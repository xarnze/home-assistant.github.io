The Synology DSM sensor platform provides access to various statistics from your [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com) as well as cameras from the [Surveillance Station](https://www.synology.com/en-us/surveillance).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

<div class='note warning'>

This sensor will wake up your Synology NAS if it's in hibernation mode.

You can change the scan interal within the configuration options (default is 15 min).

Having cameras or the Home mode toggle from [Surveillance Station](https://www.synology.com/en-us/surveillance) will fetch every 30 seconds. Disable those entities if you don't want your NAS to be fetch as frequently.

## Separate User Configuration

Due to the nature of the Synology DSM API, it is required to grant the user admin rights. This is related to the fact that utilization information is stored in the core module.

When creating the user, it is possible to deny access to all locations and applications. By doing this, the user will not be able to login to the web interface or view any of the files on the Synology NAS. It is still able to read the utilization and storage information using the API.

### If you utilize 2-Step Verification or Two Factor Authentication (2FA) with your Synology NAS

If you have the "Enforce 2-step verification for the following users" option checked under **Control Panel > User > Advanced > 2-Step Verification**, you'll need to configure the 2-step verification/one-time password (OTP) for the user you just created before the credentials for this user will work with Home Assistant. 

Make sure to log out of your "normal" user's account and then login with the separate user you created specifically for Home Assistant. DSM will walk you through the process of setting up the one-time password for this user which you'll then be able to use in Home Assistant's frontend configuration screen. 

<div class='note'>
If you denied access to all locations and applications it is normal to receive a message indicating you do not have access to DSM when trying to login with this separate user. As noted above, you do not need access to the DSM and Home Assistant will still be able to read statistics from your NAS.

Information:
- `temperature`: Displays the temperature of the NAS.
- `uptime`: Displays the uptime of the NAS (in seconds).

For each disk:
- `disk_smart_status`: Displays the S.M.A.R.T status of the disk.
- `disk_status`: Displays the status of the disk.
- `disk_temp`: Displays the temperature of the disk.

For each volume:
- `volume_status`: Displays the status of the volume.
- `volume_size_total`: Displays the total size of the volume in TB's.
- `volume_size_used`: Displays the used space on this volume in TB's.
- `volume_percentage_used`: Displays the percentage used for this volume.
- `volume_disk_temp_avg`: Displays the average temperature of all disks in the volume.
- `volume_disk_temp_max`: Displays the maximum temperature of all disks in the volume.


## Binary sensors

Security:
- `security_status`: Displays safe to indicate if the NAS is safe.

Upgrade:
- `update_available`: Displays on if a DSM update is available.

For each disk:
- `disk_exceed_bad_sector_thr`: Displays on to indicate if the disk exceeded the maximum bad sector threshold. (Does not work with DSM 5.x)
- `disk_below_remain_life_thr`: Displays on to indicate if the disk dropped below the remain life threshold. (Does not work with DSM 5.x)


## Switch
- `home_mode`: Displays a toggle to enable/disable the [Surveillance Station](https://www.synology.com/en-us/surveillance) Home mode.


## Cameras
- `{camera_name}`: Displays cameras added in [Surveillance Station](https://www.synology.com/en-us/surveillance).

## Services

### Service `synology_dsm.reboot`

Reboot the specified NAS by `serial`. If only one DSM is configured, `serial` is optional.

  | Service data attribute | Required | Description |
  | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `serial` | yes, when multiple NAS are configured | serial of DSM |

### Service `synology_dsm.shutdown`

Shutdown the specified NAS by `serial`. If only one DSM is configured, `serial` is optional.

  | Service data attribute | Required | Description |
  | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `serial` | yes, when multiple NAS are configured | serial of DSM |
