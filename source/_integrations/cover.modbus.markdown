The `modbus` cover platform allows you to control [Modbus](http://www.modbus.org/) covers (such as blinds, a roller shutter, or a garage door).

## Configuration

At the moment, we support the opening and closing of a cover. You can control your covers either using coils or holding registers.

Cover that uses the `coil` attribute is not able to determine intermediary states such as opening and closing. Coil stores only two states â€” "0" means cover closed, and "1" implies cover open. To allow detecting intermediary states, we added an optional `status_register` attribute. It will enable you to write your command (e.g., to open a cover) into a coil, and read current cover status back through the register. Additionally, you can specify values for `state_open`, `state_opening`, `state_closed`, and `state_closing` attributes. These will be matched with the value read from the `status_register`.

If your cover uses holding register to send commands (defined by the `register` attribute), it can also read the intermediary states. To adjust which value represents what state, you can fine-tune the optional state attributes, like `state_open`. These optional state values are also used for specifying values written into the register. If you specify an optional status_register attribute, cover states will be read from status_register instead of the register used for sending commands.

To use Modbus covers in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

    covers:
      - name: Door1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 1
        coil: 0
      - name: Door2
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 1
        coil: 1
        status_register: 1
      - name: Door3
        slave: 2
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 1
        register: 0
        state_open: 1
        state_closed: 0
```

## Examples

In this section, you find some real-life examples of how to use this light.

### Modbus cover controlled by a coil

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a coil. Intermediary states like opening/closing are not supported. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        coil: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
      - name: Door2
        slave: 2
        coil: 2
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
```

### Modbus cover controlled by a coil, it's state is read from the register

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a coil. Actual cover state is read from the `status_register`. We've also specified register values to match with the states open/opening/closed/closing. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
        coil: 1
        status_register: 1
        status_register_type: input
        state_opening: 1
        state_open: 2
        state_closing: 3
        state_closed: 4
```

### Modbus cover controlled by a holding register

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a holding register, from which we also read current cover state. We've also specified register values to match with the states open/opening/closed/closing. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
        register: 1
        state_opening: 1
        state_open: 2
        state_closing: 3
        state_closed: 4
```

### Modbus cover controlled by a holding register, it's state is read from the status register

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a holding register. However, cover state is read from a `status_register`. In this case, we've specified only values for `state_open` and `state_closed`, for the rest, default values are used. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
        register: 1
        status_register: 2
        register_type: holding
        state_open: 1
        state_closed: 0
```
