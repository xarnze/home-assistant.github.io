The `flux_led` support is integrated into Home Assistant as a light platform. Several brands of both bulbs and controllers use the same protocol and they have the HF-LPB100 chipset in common. The chances are high that your bulb or controller (eg. WiFi LED CONTROLLER) will work if you can control the device with the MagicHome app.

This integration will provide local control over your LED lights/strips and can be configured to auto-scan your network for controllers or for you to manually configure individual lights by their IP address.

### Configuration Details

The `flux_led` integration is configured through the Configuration -> Integrations page. You can select either auto configuration or manual configuration. For auto configuration the integration will automatically scan your network for any supported devices.

If you select the manual flow you can specify the name and host address of the light controller. You can add multiple lights/strips by adding additional instances of the integration.

### Effects

The Flux LED light offers a number of effects which are not included in other lighting packages. These can be selected from the front-end, or sent in the effect field of the `light.turn_on` command.
