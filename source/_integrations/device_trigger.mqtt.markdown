The `mqtt` device trigger platform uses an MQTT message payload to generate device trigger events.

An MQTT device trigger is a better option than a [binary sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor.mqtt/) for buttons, remote controls etc.

## Configuration

MQTT device triggers are only supported through [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/), manual setup through `configuration.yaml` is not supported.
The discovery topic needs to be: `<discovery_prefix>/device_automation/[<node_id>/]<object_id>/config`.
