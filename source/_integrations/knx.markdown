The [KNX](https://www.knx.org) integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect to KNX/IP devices.

The integration requires a local KNX/IP interface or router. Through this, it will establish a connection between Home Assistant and your KNX bus.

<div class='note warning'>

Please note, the KNX platform does not support KNX Secure.

</div>

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary Sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Cover](#cover)
- [Fan](#fan)
- [Light](#light)
- [Notify](#notify)
- [Scene](#scene)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)
- [Weather](#weather)

## Basic Configuration

To use your KNX bus in your installation, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
knx:
```

In order to make use of the various platforms that KNX offers you will need to add the relevant configuration sections to your setup. This could either all be in the Home Assistant main `configuration.yaml` file, or in a separate YAML file that you include in the main file or even be split into multiple dedicated files as shown below:

```yaml
knx:
  binary_sensor: !include knx_binary_sensor.yaml
  switch: !include knx_switch.yaml
  sensor: !include knx_sensor.yaml
  cover: !include knx_cover.yaml
  light: !include knx_light.yaml
  climate: !include knx_climate.yaml
  notify: !include knx_notify.yaml
  scene: !include knx_scene.yaml
```

Please see the dedicated platform sections below about how to configure them correctly.

Alternatively, if you want to use the [XKNX](https://xknx.io/) library abstraction (e.g., to re-use the configuration also for other scripted tools outside of Home Assistant):

```yaml
knx:
  config_file: "/path/to/xknx.yaml"
```

{% configuration %}
config_file:
  description: The path for XKNX configuration file. See [xknx.io](https://xknx.io/configuration) for details.
  required: false
  type: string
individual_address:
  description: The KNX individual address (IA) that shall be used for routing or if a tunnelling server doesn't assign an IA at connection.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "15.15.250"
multicast_group:
  description: The multicast group to use for automatic interface discovery and routing communication.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "224.0.23.12"
multicast_port:
  description: The port for multicast communication.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 3671
rate_limit:
  description: Defines the maximum number of telegrams to be sent to the bus per second (range 1-100).
  required: false
  default: 20
  type: integer
state_updater:
  description: The integration will collect the current state of each configured device from the KNX bus to display it correctly within Home Assistant. Set this option to False to prevent this behavior.
  required: false
  default: true
  type: boolean
{% endconfiguration %}

## Connection

Under normal conditions no connection configuration should be needed. The integration will auto-detect KNX/IP interfaces and connect to one. This requires multicast communication to work in your environment.

### Tunneling

If you want to connect to a sepcific tunnelling server or if the auto detection of the KNX/IP device does not work the IP or/and port of the tunneling device can be configurated.

```yaml
knx:
  tunneling:
    host: "192.168.2.23"
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: IP address of the KNX/IP tunneling device.
  type: string
  required: true
port:
  description: Port of the KNX/IP tunneling device.
  type: integer
  required: false
local_ip:
  description: IP address of the local interface.
  type: string
  required: false
{% endconfiguration %}

### Routing

Explicit connection via KNX/IP routing. This requires multicast communication to work in your environment.

```yaml
knx:
  routing:
     local_ip: "192.168.2.109"
```

{% configuration %}
local_ip:
  description: The local IP address of the interface that shall be used to send multicast packets.
  type: string
  required: true
{% endconfiguration %}

## Events

```yaml
knx:
  event_filter: ["1/0/*", "6/2,3,4-6/*"]
```

{% configuration %}
event_filter:
  description: Defines a list of patterns for filtering KNX group addresses. Telegrams with destination addresses matching this pattern are sent to the Home Assistant event bus as `knx_event`.
  required: false
  type: [list, string]
{% endconfiguration %}

Every telegram that matches the filter with its destination field will be announced on the event bus as a `knx_event` event containing data attributes

- `data` contains the raw payload data (eg. 1 or "[12, 55]").
- `destination` the KNX group address the telegram is sent to as string (eg. "1/2/3).
- `direction` the direction of the telegram as string ("Incoming" / "Outgoing"). Currently only incoming telegrams generate the event.
- `source` the KNX indidividual address of the sender as string (eg. "1.2.3").
- `telegramtype` the APCI service of the telegram. "GroupValueWrite", "GroupValueRead" or "GroupValueResponse" generate a knx_event.

## Services

In order to directly interact with the KNX bus, you can use the following services:

### Send

```txt
Domain: knx
Service: send
Service Data: {"address": "1/0/15", "payload": 0, "type": "temperature"}
```

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: KNX group address.
  type: string
payload:
  description: Payload to send to the bus. When `type` is not set, raw bytes are sent. Integers are then treated as DPT 1/2/3 payloads. For DPTs > 6 bits send a list. Each value represents 1 octet (0-255). Pad with 0 to DPT byte length.
  type: [integer, list]
type:
  description: If set, the payload will not be sent as raw bytes, but encoded as given DPT. KNX sensor types are valid values - see table in [KNX Sensor](#sensor).
  type: [string, integer, float]
{% endconfiguration %}

### Read

You can also use the `homeassistant.update_entity` service call to issue GroupValueRead requests for all `*state_address` of a device.

### Register Event

The `knx.event_register` service can be used to register (or unregister) group addresses to fire `knx_event` Events. Events for group addresses matching the `event_filter` attribute in `configuration.yaml` can not be unregistered. See [knx_event](#events)

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: Group address that shall be added or removed.
  required: true
  type: string
remove:
  description: If `True` the group address will be removed.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
{% endconfiguration %}

## Exposing entity states, entity attributes or time to KNX bus

KNX integration is able to expose entity states or attributes to KNX bus. The integration will broadcast any change of the exposed value to the KNX bus and answer read requests to the specified group address. It is also possible to expose the current time.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  expose:
    - type: "temperature"
      entity_id: "sensor.owm_temperature"
      address: "0/0/2"
    - type: "string"
      address: "0/6/4"
      entity_id: "sensor.owm_weather"
    - type: "binary"
      entity_id: "binary_sensor.kitchen_window"
      address: "0/6/5"
    - type: "binary"
      entity_id: "light.office"
      address: "0/3/0"
      default: false
    - type: "percentU8"
      entity_id: "light.office"
      attribute: "brightness"
      default: 0
      address: "0/3/1"
    - type: "time"
      address: "0/0/1"
    - type: "datetime"
      address: "0/0/23"
```

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: Group address state or attribute updates will be sent to. GroupValueRead requests will be answered.
  type: string
  required: true
type:
  description: Type of the exposed value. Either `binary`, `time`, `date`, `datetime` or any supported type of [KNX Sensor](#sensor) (e.g., "temperature" or "humidity").
  type: string
  required: true
entity_id:
  description: Entity ID to be exposed. Not needed for types `time`, `date` and `datetime`.
  type: string
  required: false
attribute:
  description: Attribute of the entity that shall be sent to the KNX bus. If not set (or `None`) the state will be sent.
    Eg. for a light the state is eigther "on" or "off". With `attribute` you can expose its "brightness".
  type: string
  required: false
default:
  description: Default value to send to the bus if the state or attribute value is `None`.
    Eg. a light with state "off" has no brightness attribute so a default value of `0` could be used.
    If not set (or `None`) no value would be sent to the bus and a GroupReadRequest to the address would return the last known value.
  type: [boolean, string, integer, float]
  default: None
  required: false
{% endconfiguration %}

## Binary Sensor

The KNX binary sensor platform allows you to monitor [KNX](https://www.knx.org/) binary sensors.

Binary sensors are read-only. To write to the KNX bus configure an exposure [KNX Integration Expose](/integrations/knx/#exposing-entity-states-entity-attributes-or-time-to-knx-bus).

```yaml
knx:
  binary_sensor:
    - name: sensor1
      state_address: "6/0/2"
```

{% configuration %}
state_address:
  description: KNX group address of the binary sensor. *DPT 1*
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: A name for this device used within Home Assistant.
  required: false
  type: string
sync_state:
  description: Actively read the value from the bus. If `false` no GroupValueRead telegrams will be sent to the bus. `sync_state` can be set to `init` to just initialize state on startup, `expire <minutes>` to read the state from the KNX bus when no telegram was received for \<minutes\> or `every <minutes>` to update it regularly every \<minutes\>. Maximum value for \<minutes\> is 1440. If just a number is configured "expire"-behaviour is used. Defaults to `true` which is interpreted as "expire 60".
  required: false
  type: [boolean, string, integer]
  default: true
device_class:
  description: Sets the [class of the device](/integrations/binary_sensor/), changing the device state and icon that is displayed on the frontend.
  required: false
  type: string
reset_after:
  description: Reset back to "off" state after specified seconds.
  required: false
  type: float
invert:
  description: Invert the telegrams payload before processing. This is applied before `context_timeout` or `reset_after` is evaluated.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
ignore_internal_state:
  description: Specifies if telegrams should ignore the internal state and always trigger a Home Assistant state update.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
context_timeout:
  description: The time in seconds between multiple identical telegram payloads would count towards the internal counter that is used for automations. Ex. You have automations in place that trigger your lights on button press and another set of lights if you click that button twice. This setting defines the time that a second button press would count toward, so if you set this 3.0 you can take up to 3 seconds in order to trigger the second button press. If set `ignore_internal_state` will be set to `true` internally. Maximum value is 10.0.
  required: false
  type: float
  default: None
{% endconfiguration %}

### Support for automations

You can use a built in event in order to trigger an automation (e.g. to switch on a light when a switch was pressed).

Let's pretend you have a binary sensor with the name `Livingroom.Switch` and you want to switch one light on when the button was pressed once and two other lights when the button was pressed twice. `context_timeout` has to be configured in order for this to work.

```yaml
# Example automation.yaml entry
automation:
  - trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.Livingroom_Switch
      attribute: counter
      above: 0
      below: 2
    condition: 
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.cover_abstell
        state: "on"
    action:
      - entity_id: light.hue_color_lamp_1
        service: light.turn_on
  - trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.Livingroom_Switch
      attribute: counter
      above: 1
      below: 3
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.cover_abstell
        state: "on"
    action:
      - entity_id: light.hue_bloom_1
        service: homeassistant.turn_on
      - entity_id: light.hue_bloom_2
        service: homeassistant.turn_on
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: A name for this device used within Home Assistant.
  required: false
  type: string
counter:
  description: Set to 2 if your only want the action to be executed if the button was pressed twice. To 3 for three times button pressed.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 1
hook:
  description: Indicates if the automation should be executed on what state of the binary sensor. Values are "on" or "off".
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "on"
action:
  description: Specify a list of actions analog to the [automation rules](/docs/automation/action/).
  required: false
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

## Climate

The KNX climate platform is used as an interface to KNX thermostats and room controllers.

To use your KNX thermostats in your installation, add the following lines to your top level [KNX Integration](/integrations/knx) configuration key in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  climate:
    - name: HASS-Kitchen.Temperature
      temperature_address: "5/1/1"
      setpoint_shift_address: "5/1/2"
      setpoint_shift_state_address: "5/1/3"
      target_temperature_state_address: "5/1/4"
      operation_mode_address: "5/1/5"
      operation_mode_state_address: "5/1/6"
```

Alternatively, if your device has dedicated binary group addresses for frost/night/comfort mode:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  climate:
    - name: HASS-Kitchen.Temperature
      temperature_address: "5/1/1"
      setpoint_shift_address: "5/1/2"
      setpoint_shift_state_address: "5/1/3"
      target_temperature_state_address: "5/1/4"
      operation_mode_frost_protection_address: "5/1/5"
      operation_mode_night_address: "5/1/6"
      operation_mode_comfort_address: "5/1/7"
      operation_mode_state_address: "5/1/8"
```

If your device doesn't support setpoint_shift calculations (i.e., if you don't provide a `setpoint_shift_address` value) please set the `min_temp` and `max_temp`
attributes of the climate device to avoid issues with exceeding valid temperature values in the frontend. Please do also make sure to add the `target_temperature_address` to the configuration in this case.:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  climate:
    - name: HASS-Kitchen.Temperature
      temperature_address: "5/1/2"
      target_temperature_address: "5/1/4"
      target_temperature_state_address: "5/1/1"
      operation_mode_frost_protection_address: "5/1/5"
      operation_mode_night_address: "5/1/6"
      operation_mode_comfort_address: "5/1/7"
      operation_mode_state_address: "5/1/8"
      operation_mode_standby_address: "5/1/9"
      min_temp: 7.0
      max_temp: 32.0
```

`setpoint_shift_mode` allows the two following DPTs to be used:

- DPT6002 (for 1 byte signed integer)
- DPT9002 (for 2 byte float)

Example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  climate:
    - name: HASS-Kitchen.Temperature
      temperature_address: "5/1/1"
      setpoint_shift_address: "5/1/2"
      setpoint_shift_state_address: "5/1/3"
      setpoint_shift_mode: "DPT9002"
      target_temperature_state_address: "5/1/4"
      operation_mode_address: "5/1/5"
      operation_mode_state_address: "5/1/6"
```

`operation_mode_frost_protection_address` / `operation_mode_night_address` / `operation_mode_comfort_address` / `operation_mode_standby_address` are not necessary if `operation_mode_address` is specified.
If the actor doesn't support explicit state communication objects the `*_state_address` can be configured with the same group address as the writeable `*_address`. The read flag for the `*_state_address` communication object has to be set in ETS to support initial reading e.g., when starting Home Assistant.

The following values are valid for the `heat_cool_address` and the `heat_cool_state_address`:

- `0` (cooling)
- `1` (heating)

The following values are valid for the Home Assistant [Climate](/integrations/climate/) `hvac_mode` attribute. Supported values for your KNX thermostats can be specified via `controller_modes` configuration variable:

- `Off` (maps internally to `HVAC_MODE_OFF` within Home Assistant)
- `Auto` (maps internally to `HVAC_MODE_AUTO` within Home Assistant)
- `Heat` (maps internally to `HVAC_MDOE_HEAT` within Home Assistant)
- `Cool` (maps internally to `HVAC_MDOE_COOL` within Home Assistant)
- `Fan only` (maps internally to `HVAC_MODE_FAN_ONLY` within Home Assistant)
- `Dry` (maps internally to `HVAC_MODE_DRY` within Home Assistant)

The following presets are valid for the Home Assistant [Climate](/integrations/climate/) `preset_mode` attribute. Supported values for your KNX thermostats can be specified via `operation_modes` configuration variable:

- `Auto` (maps internally to `PRESET_NONE` within Home Assistant)
- `Comfort` (maps internally to `PRESET_COMFORT` within Home Assistant)
- `Standby` (maps internally to `PRESET_AWAY` within Home Assistant)
- `Night` (maps internally to `PRESET_SLEEP` within Home Assistant)
- `Frost` Protection (maps internally to `PRESET_ECO` within Home Assistant)

## Fan

The KNX fan integration is used to control KNX fans. Following control types are supported:

- Percentage controlled: Fans that set the percentage directly from 0-100%.
- Step controlled: Fans which have a fixed amount of steps to set. The integration will convert percentage to step automatically. The `max_step` attribute is set to the number of steps of the fan, not counting the `off`-step. Example: A fan supports the steps 0 to 3. To use this fan the `max_step` attribute has to be set to `3`. The integration will convert the percentage `66 %` to the step `2` when sending data to KNX.

To use your KNX fan in your installation, add the following lines to your top level [KNX Integration](/integrations/knx) configuration key in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  fan:
    - name: "ceiling fan"
      address: "9/0/1"
      state_address: "9/0/2"

Many KNX devices can change their state internally without a message to the switch address on the KNX bus, e.g., if you configure a scene or a timer on a channel. The optional `state_address` can be used to inform Home Assistant about these state changes. If a KNX message is seen on the bus addressed to the given `state_address` (in most cases from the light actuator), it will overwrite the state of the switch object.

For switching/light actuators that are only controlled by a single group address and don't have dedicated state communication objects you can set `state_address` to the same value as `address`.

*Note on tunable white:* Home Assistant uses Mireds as the unit for color temperature, whereas KNX typically uses Kelvin. The Kelvin/Mireds relationship is reciprocal, not linear, therefore the color temperature pickers (sliders) in Home Assistant may not align with ones of KNX visualizations. This is the expected behavior.

    # actuator without dedicated state communication object
    - name: Cellar-Light-1
      address: "1/0/5"
      state_address: "1/0/5"
```

## Notify

The KNX notify platform allows you to send notifications to [KNX](https://www.knx.org/) devices as DPT16 strings.

```yaml
knx:
  notify:
    - name: Alarm
      address: "5/1/10"
```

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: KNX group address of the notification. *DPT 16.000*
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: A name for this device used within Home Assistant.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Scene

The KNX scenes platform allows you to trigger [KNX](https://www.knx.org/) scenes. These entities are write-only.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  scene:
    - name: Romantic
      address: 8/8/8
      scene_number: 23
```

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: KNX group address for the scene. *DPT 17.001*
  required: true
  type: string
scene_number:
  description: KNX scene number to be activated (range 1..64 ).
  required: true
  type: integer
name:
  description: A name for this device used within Home Assistant.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Sensor

The KNX sensor platform allows you to monitor [KNX](https://www.knx.org/) sensors.

Sensors are read-only. To write to the KNX bus configure an exposure [KNX Integration Expose](/integrations/knx/#exposing-entity-states-entity-attributes-or-time-to-knx-bus) or use the `knx.send` service.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  sensor:
    - name: Heating.Valve1
      state_address: "2/0/0"
      type: "percent"
```

In order to actively read the sensor data from the bus every 30 minutes you can add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  sensor:
    - name: Heating.Valve1
      state_address: "2/0/0"
      type: "percent"
      sync_state: every 30
```

{% configuration %}

  type: string
name:
  description: A name for this device used within Home Assistant.
  required: false
  type: string
sync_state:
  description: Actively read the value from the bus. If `false` no GroupValueRead telegrams will be sent to the bus. `sync_state` can be set to `init` to just initialize state on startup, `expire <minutes>` to read the state from the KNX bus when no telegram was received for \<minutes\> or `every <minutes>` to update it regularly every \<minutes\>. Maximum value for \<minutes\> is 1440. If just a number is configured "expire"-behaviour is used. Defaults to `true` which is interpreted as "expire 60".
  required: false
  type: [boolean, string, integer]
  default: true
always_callback:
  description: Defines if telegrams with equal payload as the previously received telegram should trigger a state update within Home Assistant.
  required: false

### More examples

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  sensor:
    - name: Heating.Valve1
      state_address: "2/0/0"
      sync_state: init
      type: "percent"

```

## Switch

The KNX switch platform is used as an interface to switching actuators.

```yaml
knx:
  switch:
    - name: Kitchen.Coffee
      address: "1/1/6"
```

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: KNX group address for switching the switch on/off. *DPT 1*
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: A name for this device used within Home Assistant.
  required: false
  default: KNX Switch
  type: string
state_address:
  description: Separate KNX group address for retrieving the switch state. *DPT 1*
  required: false
  type: string
invert:
  description: Invert the telegrams payload before processing or sending.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
{% endconfiguration %}

Some KNX devices can change their state internally without any messages on the KNX bus, e.g., if you configure a timer on a channel. The optional `state_address` can be used to inform Home Assistant about these state changes. If a KNX message is seen on the bus addressed to the given state address, this will overwrite the state of the switch object.
For switching actuators that are only controlled by a single group address and can't change their state internally, you don't have to configure the state address.

## Weather

The KNX weather platform is used as an interface to KNX weather stations.

To use your KNX weather station in your installation, add the following lines to your top level [KNX Integration](/integrations/knx) configuration key in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  weather:
    - name: "home"
      address_temperature: "7/0/0"
      address_brightness_south: "7/0/1"
      address_brightness_west: "7/0/2"
      address_brightness_east: "7/0/3"
      address_brightness_north: "7/0/11"
      address_wind_speed: "7/0/4"
      address_rain_alarm: "7/0/5"
      address_frost_alarm: "7/0/6"
      address_wind_alarm: "7/0/7"
      address_day_night: "7/0/8"
      address_air_pressure: "7/0/9"
      address_humidity: "7/0/10"
      expose_sensors: false
      sync_state: true
```
