The `stream` integration provides a way to proxy live streams through Home Assistant. The integration currently only supports proxying H.264 source streams to the HLS format and requires at least FFmpeg >= 4.

## Configuration

To enable this component, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
stream:
```

### Services

Once loaded, the `stream` platform will expose services that can be called to perform various actions.

#### Service `record`

Make a `.mp4` recording from a provided stream.  While this service can be called directly, it is used internally by the [`camera.record`](/integrations/camera#service-record) service.

Both `duration` and `lookback` options are suggestions, but should be consistent per stream.  The actual length of the recording may vary. It is suggested that you tweak these settings to fit your needs.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `stream_source`        |      no  | The input source for the stream, e.g., `rtsp://my.stream.feed:554`. |
| `filename`             |      no  | The file name string. e.g., `/tmp/my_stream.mp4`. |
| `duration`             |      yes | Target recording length (in seconds). Default: 30 |
| `lookback`             |      yes | Target lookback period (in seconds) to include in addition to duration.  Only available if there is currently an active HLS stream for `stream_source`. Default: 0 |

The path part of `filename` must be an entry in the `allowlist_external_dirs` in your [`homeassistant:`](/docs/configuration/basic/) section of your `configuration.yaml` file.

For example, the following action in an automation would take a recording from `rtsp://my.stream.feed:554` and save it to `/config/www`.

```yaml
action:
  service: camera.record
  data:
    entity_id: camera.quintal
    filename: "/config/www/my_stream.mp4"
    duration: 30
```

## Streaming in Lovelace

As of Home Assistant version 0.92 you can now live-stream a camera feed directly in lovelace.
To do this add either [picture-entity](/lovelace/picture-entity/), [picture-glance](/lovelace/picture-glance/) or [picture-elements](/lovelace/picture-elements/), set `camera_image` to a stream-ready camera entity and set `camera_view` to `live` in one of your Lovelace views.

## Troubleshooting

Users on manual installs with FFmpeg < 4 may see an error similar to:

```text
2020-04-28 13:35:43 ERROR (SyncWorker_5) [homeassistant.util.package] Unable to install package av==7.0.1: ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1:

         cwd: /tmp/pip-install-twd7glz2/av/
```

You can solve this by running the following steps to update FFmpeg >= 4:

```text
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/ffmpeg-4
sudo apt upgrade
```
