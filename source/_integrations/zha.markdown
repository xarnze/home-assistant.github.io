The ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation) integration allows you to connect many off-the-shelf [Zigbee based devices](https://zigbeealliance.org) directly to Home Assistant, using one of the many available Zigbee coordinators.

ZHA uses an open-source Python library implementing a hardware-independent Zigbee stack called [zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy). All coordinators compatible with zigpy can be used with ZHA.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
- Climate (beta)
- Cover
- Fan
- Light
- Lock
- Number (i.e. analog output)
- Sensor
- Switch

There is also support for grouping of lights, switches, and fans (i.e. support for commanding device groups as entities). At least two entities must be added to a group before the group entity is created.

## Compatible hardware

ZHA integration uses a hardware independent Zigbee stack implementation with modular design which means that it can support any one of the many Zigbee coordinator radio modules/adapters available from different manufacturers, as long as that module/adapter is compatible with [zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy).

Note! Zigbee 3.0 support or not in zigpy, depends primarily on your Zigbee coordinator hardware and its firmware. Some Zigbee coordinator hardware supports Zigbee 3.0 but might be shipped with an older firmware which does not. In such a case you may want to upgrade the firmware manually yourself.

Some other Zigbee coordinator hardware may not support a firmware that is capable of Zigbee 3.0 at all but can still be fully functional and feature-complete for your needs. This is very common as many, if not most, Zigbee devices do not yet Zigbee 3.0. As a general rule, newer Zigbee coordinator hardware generally supports Zigbee 3.0 firmware and it is up to its manufacturer to make such firmware available for them.

<div class="note warning">

The **EZSP** protocol requires a stable connection to the serial port. With _ITEAD Sonoff ZBBridge_ connecting over the WiFi network
it is expected to see `NCP entered failed state. Requesting APP controller restart` in the logs. This is a normal part of the operation and indicates there was a drop in communication between ZHA and SonOff bridge.

## Configuration - GUI

Connect your radio module and restart Home Assistant.

From the Home Assistant front page go to **Configuration** and then select **Integrations** from the list.

Use the plus button in the bottom right to add a new integration called **ZHA**.

In the popup:

- Serial Device Path - List of detected serial ports on the system. You need to pick one to which your
radio is connected
- Submit

Press `Submit` and the integration will try to detect radio type automatically. If unsuccessful, you will get
a new pop-up asking for a radio type. In the pop-up:

- Radio Type

| Radio Type | Zigbee Radio Hardware |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `ezsp`  | Silicon Labs EmberZNet protocol (e.g., Elelabs, HUSBZB-1, Telegesis) |
| `deconz` | dresden elektronik deCONZ protocol (e.g., ConBee I/II, RaspBee I/II) |
| `znp` | Texas Instruments new (active): Z-Stack 3.x.x ZNP protocol (e.g., CC26x2, CC13x2) |
| `ti_cc` | Texas Instruments legacy & HA12: Z-Stack Home 1.2.x ZNP protocol (e.g., CC253x) |
| `zigate` | ZiGate Serial protocol (e.g., ZiGate USB-TTL, PiZiGate, ZiGate WiFi) |
| `xbee` | Digi XBee ZB Coordinator Firmware protocol (e.g., Digi XBee Series 2, 2C, 3) |

- Submit

Press `Submit` to save radio type and you will get a new form asking for port settings specific for this
radio type. In the pop-up:
- Serial device path
- port speed (not applicable for all radios)
- data flow control (not applicable for all radios)

Most devices need at the very least the serial device path, like `/dev/ttyUSB0`, but it is recommended to use
device path from `/dev/serial/by-id` folder,
e.g., `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_HubZ_Smart_Home_Controller_C0F003D3-if01-port0`  
A list of available device paths can be found in **Supervisor** > **System** > **Host System** > **dot menu** > **Hardware**.

Press `Submit`. The success dialog will appear or an error will be displayed in the popup. An error is likely if Home Assistant can't access the USB device or your device is not up to date. Refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below for more information.

If you are use ZiGate or Sonoff ZBBridge you have to use some special usb_path configuration:

- ZiGate USB TTL or DIN: `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `auto` to auto discover the zigate
- PiZigate : `pizigate:/dev/ttyS0`
- Wifi Zigate : `socket://[IP]:[PORT]` for example `socket://192.168.1.10:9999`
- Sonoff ZBBridge : `socket://[IP]:[PORT]` for example `socket://192.168.1.11:8888`

## Configuration - YAML

For more advanced configuration, you can modify `configuration.yaml` and restart Home Assistant

{% configuration %}
database_path:
  description: _Full_ path to the database which will keep persistent network data.
  required: true
  type: string
enable_quirks:
  description: Enable quirks mode for devices where manufacturers didn't follow specs.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
{% endconfiguration %}

### OTA firmware updates

ZHA component does have the ability to automatically download and perform OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates of Zigbee devices if the OTA firmware provider source URL for updates is available. OTA firmware updating is set to disabled (`false`) in the configuration by default.

Currently, OTA providers for firmware updates are only available for IKEA and LEDVANCE devices. OTA updates for device of other manufactures could possible also be supported by ZHA dependencies in the future, if these manufacturers publish their firmware publicly.

To enable OTA firmware updates for the ZHA integration you need to add the following configuration to your `configuration.yaml` and restart Home Assistant:

```yaml
zha:
  zigpy_config:
    ota:
      ikea_provider: true                        # Auto update Trådfri devices
      ledvance_provider: true                    # Auto update LEDVANCE devices
      #otau_directory: /path/to/your/ota/folder  # Utilize .ota files to update everything else
```

You can choose if the IKEA or LEDVANCE provider should be set to enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`) individually. After the OTA firmware upgrades are finished, you can set these to `false` again if you do not want ZHA to automatically download and perform OTA firmware upgrades in the future.

Note that the `otau_directory` setting is optional and can be used for any firmware files you have downloaded yourself.

### Defining Zigbee channel to use

```yaml
zha:
  zigpy_config:
    network:
      channel: 15             # What channel the radio should try to use.
      channels: [15, 20, 25]  # Channel mask
```

This is a good reference for channel selection [Zigbee and Wifi Coexistance](https://support.metageek.com/hc/en-us/articles/203845040-ZigBee-and-WiFi-Coexistence)

### Modifying the device type

As not all device manufacturers follow the Zigbee standard, at times a device can be incorrectly classified. For example, a switch could be classified as a light.

To correct the device type, also called domain, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` and restart Home Assistant:

```yaml
zha:
  device_config:
    84:71:27:ff:fe:93:17:24-1:    # format: {ieee}-{endpoint_id}
      type: "switch"              # corrected device type
```

`{ieee}` is the device hardware address which can be read from the Home Assistant UI when looking at *Device info*. From device info, you can find the `{endpoint_id}` by viewing the *Zigbee device signature*.

## Services

### Service `zha.permit`

To add new devices to the network, call the `permit` service on the `zha` domain. Do this by clicking the Service icon in Developer tools and typing `zha.permit` in the **Service** dropdown box. Next, follow the device instructions for adding, scanning or factory reset.

This service opens network for joining new devices.

|  Data | Optional | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `duration` |  yes | For how long to allow new devices to join, default 60s
| `ieee` | yes | allow new devices to join via an existing device

To join a new device using an install code (ZB3 devices) use the following data attributes (must use parameters only
from the same group:

|  Data | Parameter Group | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `src_ieee` | install_code | The IEEE address of the joining ZB3 device. Use with `install_code`
| `install_code` | install_code | Install Code of the joining device. Use with `src_ieee`
| `qr_code` | qr_code | QR code containing IEEE and Install Code of the joining ZB3 device

<div class='note'>

  Currently `qr_code` supports QR Install Codes from:
  
  - Aqara
  - Consciot
  - Embrighten

</div>

### Service `zha.remove`

This service remove an existing device from the network.

|  Data | Optional | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `ieee` | no | IEEE address of the device to remove 

## Adding devices

To add a new device:

1. Go to the **Integrations** page, find the **Zigbee Home Automation** integration that was added by the configuration steps above, and select **Configure**.
1. Click on the plus button at the bottom right corner to start a scan for new devices.
1. Reset your Zigbee devices according to the device instructions provided by the manufacturer (e.g., turn on/off lights up to 10 times, switches usually have a reset button/pin). It might take a few seconds for the devices to appear. You can click on **Show logs** for more verbose output.
1. Once the device is found, it will appear on that page and will be automatically added to your devices. You can optionally change its name and add it to an area (you can change this later). You can search again to add another device, or you can go back to the list of added devices.

### Using router devices

You use routers to increase the number of Zigbee devices that can be used in a network. The total number of Zigbee devices that you have on a Zigbee network depends on a few things, but you should know that Zigbee coordinator hardware and firmware only plays a larger role in Zigbee networks with a lot of devices. More important is how many directly connected devices ("direct children") versus how many routers are connected to your Zigbee coordinator. Zigpy library which ZHA uses has an upper limit is 32 direct children but if your Zigbee coordinator hardware is powerful enough then you can still have hundreds of Zigbee devices connected through routers.  

Even the least powerful Zigbee coordinator hardware supported by Zigpy is CC2530/2531 and its default firmware, only supports 20 devices connected directly to the coordinator. However, by having routers in your Zigbee network the mesh network size can be extended. You can assume that most, if not all mains/AC-powered devices, e.g., wall-plugs and always powered-on lightbulbs in your Zigbee network, can serve as a router. You can even use CC2530/CC2531 with router firmware, as additional routers (which in their turn have a limit of 21 devices).

An example using the default CC2531 coordinator firmware + two CC2531 routers; Your device limit will be:

- Coordinator: 15 devices - 2 routers = 13
- Router one: + 21 devices
- Router two: + 21 devices
- Total device limit = **55 devices**

## Troubleshooting

To help resolve any kinks or compatibility problems by reporting bugs as issues with debug logs. Please follow the instructions in this troubleshooting section.

### Knowing which devices are supported

There is no official compatibility list of supported devices for the simple reason that practically all devices Zigbee Home Automation that are fully compliant with the standards and specifications as set by the [Zigbee Alliance](https://zigbeealliance.org) the should technically be compatible with this ZHA integration. The fact however remains that some hardware manufacturers do not always fully comply with each set specification which can cause a few devices to only partially work or not work at all with ZHA, but developers can create workarounds for such issues via a solution for 'ZHA exception and deviation handling' that this implementation features, please see that section for more information.

Tip to new users is that while there is no official list of supported devices, some ZHA users take comfort that blakadder maintains an unofficial Zigbee Device Compatibility Repository which anyone can submit compatibility reports to, it can be found at [zigbee.blakadder.com](https://zigbee.blakadder.com) and currently contains independent compatibility lists and device pairing tips for several home automation gateway/bridge/hub software, including but not limited to open source Zigbee implementations such as; ZHA, Tasmota, Zigbee2MQTT, and ZiGate.

### ZHA exception and deviation handling

The ZHA implementation in Home Assistant relies on a library called "[ZHA Device Handlers](https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers)" to resolve issues with Zigbee devices that do not fully conform with the Zigbee standards. The few devices that deviate from the Zigbee specifications set by the [Zigbee Alliance](https://zigbeealliance.org) may therefore require proper bug reports with debug logs from users to assistant the developers in writing custom [ZHA Device Handlers](https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers/blob/dev/README.md) for all of a device functions to work properly with the ZHA integration.

Such a custom "ZHA Device Handler" are Python scripts that internally is also referred to as a "quirk" because they fix "quirks" as in deviations from the standard specifications. ZHA Device Handles do this by transparently acting as a translator, translating and converting non-compliant device messages and instead present them to the application as coming from a virtual compliant device. These ZHA Device Handlers for Home Assistant can thus be used to parse custom messages to and from Zigbee devices. The ZHA Device Handlers that are made can then be reused by all users in future versions of Home Assistant.

The custom quirks implementations for zigpy implemented as ZHA Device Handlers for Home Assistant are a similar concept to that of [Hub-connected Device Handlers for the SmartThings Classics platform](https://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/device-type-developers-guide/) as well as that of [Zigbee-Herdsman Converters (formerly Zigbee-Shepherd Converters) as used by Zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/how_tos/how_to_support_new_devices.html), meaning they are each virtual representations of a physical device that expose additional functionality that is not provided out-of-the-box by the existing integration between these platforms.

### Reporting issues

When reporting issues, please provide the following information in addition to information requested by issue template:

1. Debug logs for the issue, see [debug logging](#debug-logging)
2. Model of Zigbee radio being used
3. If issue is related to a specific Zigbee device, provide device Zigbee signature. Signature is available at
**Configuration** -> **Integrations** -> **Zigbee Home Automation** (click **Configure**) -> **Devices** (pick your device) -> **Zigbee Device Signature**

### Debug logging

To enable debug logging for ZHA component and radio libraries, add the following [logger](/integrations/logger/) configuration to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    homeassistant.core: debug
    homeassistant.components.zha: debug
    bellows.zigbee.application: debug
    bellows.ezsp: debug
    zigpy: debug
    zigpy_cc: debug
    zigpy_deconz.zigbee.application: debug
    zigpy_deconz.api: debug
    zigpy_xbee.zigbee.application: debug
    zigpy_xbee.api: debug
    zigpy_zigate: debug
    zigpy_znp: debug
    zhaquirks: debug
```

### Add Philips Hue bulbs that have previously been added to another bridge

Philips Hue bulbs that have previously been added to another bridge won't show up during search. You have to restore your bulbs back to factory settings first. To achieve this, you basically have the following options.

#### Philips Hue Dimmer Switch

Using a Philips Hue Dimmer Switch is probably the easiest way to factory-reset your bulbs. For this to work, the remote doesn't have to be paired with your previous bridge.

1. Turn on your Hue bulb you want to reset
2. Hold the Dimmer Switch near your bulb (< 10 cm)
3. Press and hold the (I)/(ON) and (O)/(OFF) buttons of the Dimmer Switch for about 10 seconds until your bulb starts to blink
4. Your bulb should stop blinking and eventually turn on again. At the same time, a green light on the top left of your remote indicates that your bulb has been successfully reset to factory settings.

#### hue-thief

Follow the instructions on [https://github.com/vanviegen/hue-thief/](https://github.com/vanviegen/hue-thief/) (EZSP-based Zigbee USB stick required)

### ZHA Start up issue with Home Assistant or Home Assistant Container

On Linux hosts ZHA can fail to start during HA startup or restarts because the Zigbee USB device is being claimed by the host's modemmanager service. To fix this disable the modemmanager on the host system.

To remove modemmanager from a Debian/Ubuntu host run this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge modemmanager
```

### Can't connect to USB device and using Docker

If you are using Docker and can't connect, you most likely need to forward your device from the host machine to the Docker instance. This can be achieved by adding the device mapping to the end of the startup string or ideally using Docker compose.

#### Docker Compose

Install Docker-Compose for your platform (Linux - `sudo apt-get install docker-compose`).

Create a `docker-compose.yml` with the following data:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  homeassistant:
    # customizable name
    container_name: home-assistant

    # must be image for your platform, this is the rpi3 variant
    image: homeassistant/raspberrypi3-homeassistant
    volumes:
      - <DIRECTORY HOLDING HOME ASSISTANT CONFIG FILES>:/config
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    devices:
      # your usb device forwarding to the docker image
      - /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
```
