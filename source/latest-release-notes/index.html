Ugly workaround to make the release notes for 0.106 redirect nicely.
We did a special release with a blog post, so the latest release Notes
are going the wrong way. This hack can be removed after 0.107 is released.
{% endcomment %}
{% if site.current_minor_version == 106 %}
  {% assign posts = site.categories['Release-Notes'] | where_exp: "post", "post.title contains 'Light brightness stepping'" %}
{% else %}
  {% assign posts = site.categories['Release-Notes'] | where_exp: "post", "post.title contains site.current_minor_version" %}
{% endif %}
{% assign recent_release_post = posts.first %}

<script>
  document.location = '{{ recent_release_post.url }}{{ site.patch_version_notes }}';
</script>
