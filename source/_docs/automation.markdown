Home Assistant contains information about all your devices and services. This information is not only available for the user in the dashboard, it can also be used to trigger automations. And that's fun!

Automations in Home Assistant allow you to automatically respond to things that happen. You can turn the lights on at sunset or pause the music when you receive a call.
